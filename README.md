# Powershell

A bunch of Powershell scripts I wrote for a project.  The codes should be generic enough to be used in any Windows environment.  Some of the more simpler scripts were written so it could be run within a Tanium environment.

copydifftosp - Make a copy of a report that exists in one directory that doesnâ€™t exist in another. (obsolete)

create_rpt - Create a report based on the findings of named spreadsheets. (obsolete)

Get-AntiVirus - Identifies the antivirus running on a host

Get-COM15 - Identifies what communication port a device is attached to.  Default is COM15.

Get-DumpWER - Identify if a Windows Error Report (i.e., dump) exists on the register

Get-EventID - Identify if certain security events occurred

Get-Executeable - Identify if the systems allows remote execution without credentials

Get-FirewallRules - Identify what firewall rules are on the system

Get-HTML - Identify if a webserver is running

Get-NCSI - Identify if the registers are configured to automatically communicate back to Microsoft

Get-SSL - Inventory the SSL Certificates

selecthosts - This script will create a stratified sampling of systems and assigns a date of when a given script should be executed. Scheduling is designed to skip weekends and holidays.
